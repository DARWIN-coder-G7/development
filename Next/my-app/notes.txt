React Server Components

  --By default next.js treats all components as server components
  --These Components can Perform-server-side-tasks like Reading Files and fetching data from DB
  --The Problem is they Can't use React hooks or handle user Interactions.

Client Components

  --Need to add "Use Client" Directive at the top of the component Files
  --These are traditional react components not capable of reacting with DB or reading Files

Routing
 
 --Files and folder structures
   1. All Routes must live inside the App Folder
   2.Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
   3.Each Folder Repersents the segment of the Url Path

layout.tsx
   Even If you delete this file then do npm run dev next js will automatically generate this file

Private folder  _
  A way to tell Next.js hey this folder is just for internal stuff - don't include it in the routing system.
  The folder and all its subfolders are excluded from routing
  Add an underscore at the start of the folder Name.

----- why routing through tsx
Basically in Next.js we are supposed to create our components as a seperate folder away from app Folder
The reason Behind this is we are seggregating our routes as a seperate folder logic 

Group Routes
  To Group the routes  we need to create a base folder with name wrapped by 9 and 0 brackets like this (folderName)
  Then that folder will have so many folders within that so each of it will have a page.tsx file

How to create Layouts
  Layouts like keeping Header and Footer as static one and the content in between will change dynamically
  Export a component from layout.tsx or layout.js file
  That Component takes a children Prop which next js will populate  with your page content

Multiple Root Layouts
if in case there is a Need that we dont want to show the header and footer for login and few other Routes
  Route group uses:
   Organize our project structure without affecting URLs
   Apply Layouts Selectively to Specific parts of our Application

Routing MetaData
   The MetaData API in Next Js is a Poweful feature which will letus define Metadata for each page

   two ways to handle metaDATA in layout or page .tsx files
     1. export a static -- metadata -- Object
     2. export a dynamic --  generateMetadata --  function

  But we cant use both the MetaData Object and the function at the same component level
  Then it is having a hierarchy like angular providers the closer one will be on precedence
  For example the title on page .tsx will be on the meta tag it will override its parent and root everything

  Then One More Point this Metadata wont work on client components 
  so we have to use server side components as a wrapper of our client side to achieve metaData

    We can define Our title Either as a string or as a Object 
      title:"as a string"
      title:{
        default:"Will Act as a fallback title when any of the Nested page or layout files Doesnt Specify any titles",
        template:"%s | Website name" so it will append this template to all sub pages and layouts of where it is attached,
        absolute:" Just a title when we want to override the template we can Use it"
      }
  
  Link tag

    Replace is directive which will Be helpful when User want to override the history of previous Url 
    for example when we go to products from blog and then from products to product page back button will help us to land on blog instead of products List

Catching Params from Url

    Async await for server components To access params and search params (query params)
    use hook for client side components

    page.tsx will have both params and query params but layout.tsx is having acces for params only 
    For using params in Client side we have to rely on Use hook from React

Templates
   Templates are also similar share Ui between multiple pages in our APP 
   But for every page a new instance will Be Generated
   It should be either template.js or template.tsx 

   We cam simply use template.tsx instead of layout.tsx where we need  
   If we use both means template will be child of layout then page will be child of template instead of earlier page will be child of layout
   without template   ----    layout --> page
   with template      ----    layout --> template --> page

Loading
   loading.tsx

Error Handling
  Error.tsx   export an default function named ErrorBoundary will always be a client component
  can catch the error and display then we can let the user to reload the component
  Errors always bubble up to find the closest error boundary  (The same concept is almost all Js )
  but error boundary is not at all capable catching errors thrown by 
  layout or template on the same folder if the error.tsx is on one folder above then it can handle
  Because as by hierarchy layout is above

    <Layout>
        <Template>
            <ErrorBoundary fallback={<Error />} >
                <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
                    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<NotFound />}>
                        <Page/>
                    </ErrorBoundary>
                </Suspense>
            </ErrorBoundary>
        </Template>
    </Layout>

Global Error Handling
   global-error.tsx   to handle errors thrown by layouts are root layouts

Parallel Routes @
   In next js parallel routes is a concept that lets us Render multiple Pages simultaneously within same Layout
   So instead of creating a normal nested folder we have to create it with a convention folder name starts with @symbol
   so that it can be registered as slots all slots within that folder will be available as Props of the layout Folder

   These are mainly for independent route handling  independent loading and error states works like an island
   Each slot can essentialy behave  as a mini application ,completely with its  own Navigation and State Management

Conditional Routes 
   Conditional Routes allows us to achieve this while maintaining completely seperate code On the same URl
   Want to display Dashboard for Authenticated and Login for Others  
   but truth is its just bull shit

Intercepting Routes (.)
   Allows us to load a route from another part of the Application within Current Layout
   so basically the Idea is without loading login page we show it as a popup but if we reload the App Then we can login page 
   we are updating the url but instead of redirecting to that page we are sjowing it as a popup
   This bullshit is also same as literally like default.tsx in Parallel routes
   (.)   to match segements on the same level
   (..)  to match segments of one level Above
   (..)  to match segments of two level above
   (...) to match segments from the Root App directory
